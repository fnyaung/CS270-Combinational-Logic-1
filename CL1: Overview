In this module, you'll learn about an area of mathematics called Boolean algebra. 
The fundamental unit in boolean algebra is a variable that can have one of only two 
possible values - true or false (sometimes represented as 1 or 0). This module is aligned with course outcome E:

Design simple combinational circuits and use Boolean Algebra and standard circuit minimization techniques to simplify them.

While you won't learn about the "circuits" part of this outcome in this module, you'll build the 
necessary foundational knowledge of Boolean algebra and minimization to tackle concepts related to 
actual hardware circuits in the next module.

As you learned in the last module, computers are good at storing and transmitting information as sequences 
of 1s and 0s. For this reason, learning Boolean algebra is an essential part of learning about the inner 
workings of a computer.

You'll learn about the logical operators AND, OR, and NOT. These operators can be used in conjunction with 
Boolean variables to form larger Boolean expressions. You'll also learn some rules that can help in proving 
equivalence between two boolean expressions and reducing a boolean expression to a simpler form.

Once you've learned the fundamentals of boolean algebra, you'll learn to use Karnaugh maps to simply boolean 
expressions in sum-of-products form.
