In this module, you can cover all the major concepts with just the videos or just the readings. 
However, I'd still recommend reviewing both when you have time. The videos probably have small 
details or helpful hints that the readings do not have, and vice versa.

Readings:
1) Computer Mathematics (J. Craig Lowery, Ph.D.):  
   http://sandbox.mc.edu/~bennet/cs110/textbook/
   * Please read the fifth module. *
2) Introduction to Karnaugh Maps (Andrew W.H. House, University of Toronto):
   http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~ahouse/mirror/engi3861/kmaps.pdf
   * Note that this text contains some small references to hardware (specifically, 
   logic gates and multiplexors) which we have not yet covered. *
